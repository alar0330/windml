.. .. topic:: Machine learning library for wind energy information systems. 

The importance of wind in smart grids with a large number of renewable energy resources is increasing. 
With the growing infrastructure of wind turbines and the availability of time-series data with high spatial and temporal resolution, the application of data mining techniques comes into play. 
The `windML framework <https://github.com/cigroup-ol/windml>`_ provides an easy-to-use access to wind data sources within the **Python** world, building upon `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ [1]_, `scipy <http://scipy.org>`_ [1]_, `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ [3]_, and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_ [2]_. 
As a machine learning module, it provides versatile tools for various learning tasks like time-series prediction, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and related tasks. 



Getting Started
---------------

For an installation guide, an overview of the architecture, and the functionalities of windML, please visit the :ref:`gettingstarted` page. For a formal description of the applied techniques, see section :ref:`techniques`. The :ref:`examples` gallery illustrates the main functionalities.

Brief Example
-------------

In the following, we give a brief example
of wind time-series forecasting based on *K nearest neighbors* (KNN) regression.
For a further list of examples with plots, we refer to the :ref:`examples` page.
 ::

  from windml.datasets.nrel import NREL
  from windml.mapping.power_mapping import PowerMapping
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
  import math
  
  windpark = NREL().get_windpark(NREL.park_id['tehachapi'], 3, 2004, 2005)
  target = windpark.get_target()
  
  feature_window, horizon = 3, 3
  mapping = PowerMapping()
  X = mapping.get_features_park(windpark, feature_window, horizon)
  Y = mapping.get_labels_turbine(target, feature_window, horizon)
  reg = KNeighborsRegressor(10, 'uniform')
  
  train_to, test_to = int(math.floor(len(X) * 0.5)), len(X)
  train_step, test_step = 5, 5
  reg = reg.fit(X[0:train_to:train_step], Y[0:train_to:train_step])
  y_hat = reg.predict(X[train_to:test_to:test_step])



Wind Power Prediction
--------------------------

The model predicts wind power exclusively based on past wind power
measurements.  For this task, one can formulate the prediction as regression
problem examplary for a single turbine. The wind power measurement
:math:`\mathbf{x} = p(t)` (pattern) is mapped to the power production at target
time :math:`y = p(t+\lambda)` (label).  For the regression model, we assume to
have :math:`N` of such pattern label pairs :math:`(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)` that are
basis of our training set
:math:`T=\{(\mathbf{x}_1,y_1),\ldots,(\mathbf{x}_N,y_N)\}` and allow via a
regression to predict the label for unknown patterns. It can be expected that
the model yields better predictions, if more information of the times series is
employed. For this reason, we extend the patterns with :math:`\mu \in
\mathbb{N^+}` past measurements to :math:`\mathbf{x} = p(t), p(t - 1),\ldots,
p(t - \mu)`. The implementation of this approach is called :ref:`powermapping`.

Furthermore, we test, if taking into account differences of measurements
:math:`p(t)-p(t-1), \ldots, p\big(t-(\mu-1)\big) - p(t-\mu)` further improves
the results. The absolute values and their differences result in patterns with
a dimension of :math:`d_{st}=(2\mu+1)`, see :ref:`powerdiffmapping`. Most
prediction tasks require the construction of a pattern which consists of wind
power time series of turbines in the neighborhood of the target turbine.
See the corresponding figure below. A wind park is defined by a target wind
turbine and a certain radius :math:`r`. Wind power values can be aggregated to a
single value or can seperately be used in the pattern vector.
